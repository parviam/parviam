                    Hi! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech, but am currently on leave to be an <a href="https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship" target="_blank">Astra Fellow</a> (fieldbuilding track) at Constellation in Berkeley, working under Alexandra Bates. I also serve as the Collaborative Initiatives Lead at the <a href="https://www.aisi.dev" target="_blank">AI Safety Initiative at Georgia Tech</a>, a community of technical and policy researchers focused on mitigating catastrophic risks from AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm highly interested in engaging national security and academic communities to address catastrophic risks from AI, especially under short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gabPgK9e83QrmcvbK/what-s-up-with-anthropic-predicting-agi-by-early-2027-1" target="_blank">timelines</a>. Some of my previous work involves studying LLM use in wargaming and benchmarking <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mxsy7wYvsCRv5dGrw/tastybench-toward-measuring-research-taste-in-llm" target="_blank">non-engineering AI R&D automation</a>. I also authored a Georgia Tech RFI <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-mOQTscqrnTDjfuUNyF841Fv8DWavy4Da6I5xT7tX4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">response</a> to the National AI R&D Action Plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before this, I worked at the <a href="https://www.gtri.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a>, a DoD-affiliated applied research lab, where I focused on extremely novel cyberbiosecurity threats and evaluating frontier models for CBRN risks. I'm based between Atlanta and Berkeley, and write occasionally on my <a href="{{ '/blog' | relative_url }}">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/parv-mahajan" target="_blank">LessWrong</a>. Always happy to talk to folks - have a very low bar for reaching out!
