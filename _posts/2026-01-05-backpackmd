As I gear up for a couple days of travel, I'm revisiting what's in my backpack! Heavily inspired by [Aaron Bergman](https://x.com/aaronbergman18/status/2005450347452703066?s=46), here's my preparedness list:

- Alcohol swabs (3x)
- Medical tape (1x, roll)

- USB stick (64Gb)
- Advil - Ibuprofen 200mg tablets (~10x)
- Neosporin - Antibiotic ointment (0.5oz)
- Emergen-C (1x, probably should add more)
