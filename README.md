Hi! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech, but am currently on leave to be an [Astra Fellow](https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship) (fieldbuilding track) at Constellation in Berkeley, working under Alexandra Bates. I also serve as the Collaborative Initiatives Lead at the [AI Safety Initiative at Georgia Tech](https://www.aisi.dev), a community of technical and policy researchers focused on mitigating catastrophic risks from AI.

I'm highly interested in engaging national security and academic communities to address catastrophic risks from AI, especially under short [timelines](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gabPgK9e83QrmcvbK/what-s-up-with-anthropic-predicting-agi-by-early-2027-1). Some of my previous work involves studying LLM use in wargaming and benchmarking [non-engineering AI R&D automation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mxsy7wYvsCRv5dGrw/tastybench-toward-measuring-research-taste-in-llm). I also authored a Georgia Tech RFI [response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-mOQTscqrnTDjfuUNyF841Fv8DWavy4Da6I5xT7tX4/edit?usp=sharing) to the National AI R&D Action Plan.

Before this, I worked at the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu), a DoD-affiliated applied research lab, where I focused on extremely novel cyberbiosecurity threats and evaluating frontier models for CBRN risks. I'm based between Atlanta and Berkeley, and write occasionally on my [Substack](https://parvmahajan.substack.com) and [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/parv-mahajan). Always happy to talk to folks - havtimelines. Some of my previous work e a very low bar for reaching out!
